# Frontend Design Rules

## Core Principle

**No AI Slop.** Every UI you create should be exceptional, not generic.

Don't use any MCPs, skills, or other features in your harness. Show me your organic built-in capabilities for tasteful design.

**Use your frontend design skill to make these designs exceptional.**

## CRITICAL: Five Design Variants

**For every project that involves a frontend UI, create FIVE different designs.**

Each design should be creative and unique from all the others that you create. They should be hosted on /1, /2, /3, /4 and /5 respectively.

This allows the user to pick from distinct aesthetic directions rather than accepting a single AI-generated default.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme for each variant:
  - Brutally minimal
  - Maximalist chaos
  - Retro-futuristic
  - Organic/natural
  - Luxury/refined
  - Playful/toy-like
  - Editorial/magazine
  - Brutalist/raw
  - Art deco/geometric
  - Soft/pastel
  - Industrial/utilitarian
  - NOC/dark mode operator
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work. The key is intentionality, not intensity.

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial, Inter, Roboto, and system fonts. Opt for distinctive choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, grain overlays.

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)

- Generic Inter/Roboto/Arial/system fonts
- Cliched purple gradients on white backgrounds
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character
- Same aesthetic across all five variants
- Converging on common "safe" choices (Space Grotesk, etc.)
- Overused Tailwind/Bootstrap defaults without customization

## For Improving Existing Projects

When polishing or reviewing frontend code:
- Identify generic or "AI slop" patterns and replace them
- Improve visual consistency across components
- Enhance micro-interactions and feedback
- Refine spacing, alignment, and typography
- Add subtle polish that elevates the experience

## Remember

Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back. Show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.

Each of the five designs should feel like it was created by a different designer with a different aesthetic philosophy.
