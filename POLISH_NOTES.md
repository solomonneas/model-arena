# Model Arena - Polish Notes

## Missing Models (Priority)

### Anthropic
- Claude Opus 4.5
- Claude Opus 4.6

### OpenAI
- GPT 5
- GPT 5.2
- GPT 5.3 (Codex)

### Moonshot (Kimi)
- Kimi K2
- Kimi K2.5

Add all of these with accurate benchmark data, pricing, and capability comparisons.

## Frontend Redesign
- Apply the **frontend-design skill** with **5 distinct visual variants**
- Use the `templates/frontend-5-variants/` scaffold
- Each variant should have a completely different aesthetic
- Current UI needs a full overhaul, not just data updates

## Other Notes
- Review existing model data for accuracy (benchmarks may be outdated)
- Ensure comparison charts/visualizations scale with the added models
